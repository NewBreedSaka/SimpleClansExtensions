This plugin is used to extend the functionality of SimpleClans to make is easier to use in a PvP setting.  You can type /sce join <clan name> to instantly join a clan or create it if it doesn't exist.  There are checks to ensure team balance.  Players can only join low population clans and can't switch from their current clan unless its over populated.  It also tracks building on a map and whether or not they are destroyed.  This plugin is currently a work in progress.
